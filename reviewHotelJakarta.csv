Hotel Gran Mahakam,Robert Gow,4.0,"Old boutique hotel but very well maintained. Reception, concierge, restaurant, housekeeping and security staff ALL very polite and helpful. In-room amenities are complete . I stayed in a standard room then later upgraded to deluxe suite and found the bedding in both very comfortable. There were insufficient number of power outlets accommodate my laptop and chargers for tablet and phone, so I purchased a cable extension at the Block-M Mall which is conveniently located 200 meters from the hotel. I can highly recommend the Gran Mahakam Hotel for both business and family travel."

Hotel Gran Mahakam,Fifi Muliadi,5.0,"When I was working, I frequently visited the hotel for meeting, doing lunches and dinners. I have always like this very specialized boutique hotel. And I had my wedding reception there as well handled by Hadi Praja, everything was on point, fantastic, from check in to wedding reception until check out, with my guests all praising the good food and great valet service. The only complaint from them is the access to the hotel on a Saturday night was heavy traffic. Thank you Gran Mahakam"

Hotel Gran Mahakam,Swathi V,5.0,"My stay was a combination of quarantine and normal stay. Easily the best quarantine food I have had so far. Delightful desserts included too! The hotel was not fully open due to CoVID closure of the spa and limited pool service. However everything else was delightful. The staff and service was amazing, they assisted swiftly on all matters. The food at the restaurant was delicious. For guests with breakfast options, they even had complimentary in room breakfast."

Hotel Gran Mahakam,Mida Hardo,5.0,"I stayed at Gran Mahakam for repatriation. We stayed for 10 days 9 night as per the current govenrment regulation. We felt grateful to get the rooms here. The hotel staff we met at the airport was friendly and helpful. He helped us to find the local SIM card, so that we can still continue connected with social media while waiting our PCR result. The check in was flawless and very helpfull as we reached there around 1 AM. Only the access to the hotel was a bit confusing at the start ( due to the regulation, the main street was blocked). However, it got resolved after I called the hotel. The reception gave very clear direction to the driver. The car was very comfortable. They had Alphard to pick us up. We had a nice “sekoteng” ginger sweet drink sent to the room to warm us up. We rested well and very much pampered by the sophisticated menu selections (regular, kids menu, vegetarian, or glutten free menus). We mostly ordered Indonesian food during our stay. I also worked from quarantine. The wifi connection is okay. Few glitches, but still acceptable. I can ask the hotel to help for printing some important documents. Everytime we need extra items (ie adaptor, yoga mat, water bottle), the staffs will provide it immediately. Let me share the pictures that will give you ideas why we enjoyed our stay there. Thanks for everyone there !"
Hotel Gran Mahakam,NATALIA MARGARET THATCHER,4.0,here for a wedding party. Good wedding / gathering space but the parking area is small.
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Annisa Diana,5.0,"One of the most comfortable hotel in South Jakarta. I love the ambience, the cleanliness and how the staff treat us really well. I got the room at 8th floor, with citylight view at night. The location at Blok M is really strategic so we can go everywhere by foot easily. Maybe due to pandemic, they serve basic menu for breakfast so there are not so much variant menu served."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,davy Sukamta,5.0,"The grande old dame, this very beautiful hotel located right in the hearth of Blok M Kebayoran Baru. Designed in art noveau style, this boutique hotel provides decent size rooms, a pool and several restaurants. Service is first rate. The buffet lunch and dinner is great. The bar is cozy. And they provides parking space in the basement"

Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Shabrina Indah Fitriani,5.0,"Perfect location, easy to get around. Great ambience. Friendly service. Comfy and clean room. Veranda has a restaurant called Wyl’s Kitchen on the ground floor which is really beautiful for weddings or any events. Spacious parking area. Reasonable prices."
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Sonny SPH,4.0,"Beautiful hotel with touch of Japanese style locates near to Pakubuwono Signature. The lobby is quite big which could be considered as lounge since has many sofa, chairs and tables with beautiful yet unique ornaments. The front desk has two areas of table for receiving guests with each has its own chair. I occupied two rooms for me and family and the room was nice. The most i liked about the room was its bed, nice one. The restaurant was not big to my opinion but has beautiful theme color of white and space of restaurant could be expanded by using some space next to it of swimming pool area. The menu of the breakfast was not so many but complete one. The most i like about the restaurant is the taste of its food especially sambal and nasi goreng/fried rice, the nasi goreng and sambal really delicious and also not to forget its fried noodle. The swimming pool was not so big with depth of 1.2m but it was good enough and surrounded by green tree and plant and nice flower. The hotel has gym area on the second floor which although not so big but has enough equipments and treadmill completed with toilets with clean arrangement. The parking lot was small either in the basement and outer area and there was no lift to the basement of parking lot so this could be an issue when going to drop and take the suitcase. Just make sure you drop off and load luggages on the lobby area. Still inside the hotel area, next to its restaurant there was another public Japanese restaurant named Sumoji. The hotel has small nice veranda on its front area with beautiful flowers and greenery. One of my issues beside of the drop off luggages was neither the front office officer nor the restaurant officer seemed reluctantly accepted my payment, they seemed would like to delay in accepting the payment. Overall it was nice hotel and worth staying at. Thank you to the all hotel staffs especially Nadya of the restaurant and the security officers. PS: i did notice of the security officers in the main entrance, they welcoming guest and issuing parking ticket. To the management, could you give them small chair to sit so they do not have to standing in hours? sorry this is just my concern."
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Piter Halim,4.0,"Nice and enjoyable, close to get anywhere, especially to Gandaria City Mal which only around 1KM only. Love the swimming pool, its quite long and not crowded at all. There was nobody at the pool, perhaps because I always swim at the morning :) The Room itself neat and clean, the aircon is cold! Cons : the internet so damn slow. Its a shame the hotel with this quality cant provide better connection. Hopefully in future they will upgrade the bandwith."
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Eric Effin' P - MTB Content,4.0,"Close to Senayan golf and also PIM golf. It's a good golf hotel for the enthusiastics. Hotel is well positioned just 500m away from Gandaria city. Food is good and the surrounding quiet - request for pool rooms, else the road rooms can be very noisy. Rooms are good and all works well. For those who want to have events there however, be prepared for hectic jams because the carpark is relatively small."

Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,kisuk Son,4.0,"I think it will be really difficult to find a hotel like this in JKT with same price. Room was clean and cozy with wooden furniture. Some 5 star hotels in JKT do not provide Aqua(Dannon) as complimentary service, but this hotel gives. Air conditioner waa also good. Fitness gym was small but still can work out.(with techno gym products.) I will recommend this hotel to my friend if my friend want a economical option. But only the bathroom...there was some moss. It can be cleaned with more attention..."

Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Unnikrishnan Palloor,2.0,Services were very poor. Not getting response from the reception most of the time. Two times I got plastic paper along with sausage. Reported to the food serving people. Other major issue is language. Few people only speak English. Airport pick up and air port drop also they promised while picking up from airport. But at the time of check out they refused give airport drop service. Moreover they charged 12 million for 9 nights quarantine no invoice given. I will never recommend this hotel to anybody.
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Kelvin,2.0,"Im stay for 1night. But ive got room not cleaned, the table, floor are very dusty. The glasses cup and toilet are wet and not cleaned well, when check in the reception staff are not very welcome. Its just bad experienceRooms: 1/5 | Service: 1/5 | Location: 2/5 …More"
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Leticia K,2.0,"Nicely designed and cozy atmosphere BUT cleanliness and service can definitely be improved. Found out from the housekeeping guy that he is in charge of cleaning ALL rooms within 2 floors ALONE. no wonder the rooms are dusty and doubt the bathroom has been cleaned thoroughly prior to our checkin, judging from the water stains. Another weird point is there is NO concierge service... how does it count as 4 star hotel? Any kind of package, day or night, can't be received by reception or security or anyone in the hotel so all courier have to wait for guests in the lobby although there is a separate concierge desk right on that lobby. Why bother having so many security personnel in the lobby then? Maybe the hotel is cutting cost for concierge service? but still, bad experience for 4 stars hotel, we've experienced better service from 2* Apartotel that costs 1/3 of what Veranda is charging. Such a disappointment and current management / service needs to be improved, else people also won't repeat stay here. Last but not least, still about service, it always took so long to deliver anything to your room. Often times, there's nobody picking up the Housekeeping or Room Service Line and it always take ~30mins to request for something, even as simple as tissue paper or new towels."
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Lucky Snack Official,3.0,"It seems like 3 star hotel. The facilities is so so. Breakfast was very simple and the taste was not good Maybe need some improvement for 4 star hotel standard. In front of the neighbour room, there is the dirty dishes that are not taken from the night before till the day after"
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,IG: onaldtan,5.0,"If you are about to find a quiet place to stay around Gandaria, Pondok Indah, but didn't want to miss some attractions around Senayan and Blok M, choose this place. A cozy hotel with a good ambience and a fair cleanliness. The check in process was less than 5 mins. No deposit money needed. They are able to give you up to 3 access key card to your room. The lift was the touch less one and for going up, you'll need to tap the room key card that automatically brings you to your room. The room is spacious with 2 wooden chair, safety box, large TV, internet connection, panoramic window, and queen bed with 5 pillows. The amenities was ok, nothing to complaint. Go down to the lobby you'll find wylz kitchen for breakfast and all day dining place, a 1.2m deep swimming pool (til 8 pm using), and fitness center. Every morning the housekeeper will come and ask if you got any laundry to do. The only thing that comes to my concern was the pest control, found some ants around my sink and the use of mask for the housekeeper, they need to see it as a health protocol and hygiene. A pleasant stay anyway."
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,muhammad iqbal,4.0,Breakfast is not good enough here but the view is great.
Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Sutini Irsan,4.0,"The hotel was packed as there's a wedding celebration also the promotion room rates at Agoda. After 1,5 hour of waiting, finally we got the room key.

Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Soraya Salsabila,3.0,"I've stayed at the veranda hotel 3 times. for the rooms are quite spacious and clean, the bathroom is also clean & the AC room is very cold. I always take the breakfast one, the breakfast is delicious but the menu variants are not much. But what I really lack is the cleanliness of the swimming pool, from above it looks fine. Tapi jika melihat ke dalam air, it's a lot of dirt and garbage. very disgusting, there are tissues, plastic, daun, debu. 3 times come here and swimming pool always dirty!!! disappointing"

Veranda Hotel at Pakubuwono,Indra Prasetya,1.0,"This is my second time book & staying in veranda. The first one working out just fine, even though at the reception upon checkin seems unprofessional and empty. I have to wait approx. 30 minutes until i got to check in, idk if its the outdated checkin method or just the reception not up to its professionalism but it turn out fine (the rooms, cleanliness, service etc. are good). Fast forward to the second time, this is where i got dissapointed. Upon booking through apps, i decided to book veranda and it does not have the must test antigen policy upon checkin (i check more than twice) in the hotel room policy details when selecting rooms. At the arrival, again the reception and front office is empty, they hang out at the back office which is located in side of reception table this again show unprofessionalism. Then i talk to the receptionist, i was rejected because it has to present antigen test, i am confused coz it does not say that in the booking apps. Then i showd the hotel rooms page at the apps, is does not say that, but she scrolling and scrolling like she wants to find that will justified the rejection. It came to the point where she shows the hotel policy page which is hidden in the front page i believe it has to be an extra move cos how the heck do i or anybody else see that. Then again she ask me to do the test at the nearest clinic (really?) this is an insult. Not to mention that i alr vaccinated 2 times, she could consider that and tell the manager about this issue which is not my fault. I’d be happy to walk away if that happen."

Sutasoma Hotel,Najwa Mazli,5.0,"Great experience in a new hotel in Jakarta selatan. Service was very very good, they ensure everything is perfect. My husband has mobility issues and we informed that he can’t climb stairs, the hotel set up a nice area for us to sit for breakfast at the cafe. The cafe has a wheelchair lift too. Clean room, good AC, delicious breakfast, nice size swimming pool. Minor critic would be the shower heads in our room tend to sprit water all over. As the hotel is quite new and inside the Tribrata area, grab drivers usually takes time to find the hotel. We received farewell card and goodies checking out."

Sutasoma Hotel,Andy Jonatan,4.0,"I am completely aware that it is outside hotels ability to ensure all it's guests to behave in a respectful way. However, having a what may appeared as a group of young women who loudly chatted the whole night up until the odd hours would certainly cause a great inconvenience to the other guests; in this case that would be me. Unfortunately, the loud conversation kept going, even after I have informed the reception at 4 in the morning. Staff members are super friendly, polite and welcoming. Check in was easy and location was easy to find. Ultra convenient, as it was a whizz away from blok A MRT station if you wish to travel from or between places. Blok M is only 1 station away, where food are abundance. Room is modern and clean. Smelled amazing throughout the hallway, room and the bathroom. The pool area can be accessed from the lobby. This is a nice area surrounded by leafy vegetations and water is always clean. The gym contained very basic hotel-graded equipment. Some of the machine is way old and passed its functioning time and urgently needed replacements. Breakfast is the highlight of this hotel. Selections are huge. From your a erage continentals, pastries and egg dish to the traditional Indoenesian bfasts. Who in the world would eat succulent beef rendang and flamed grilled chicken in the morning? But apparently they were served and worked well. Linda from Atman lounge was super friendly customer service. Never once forget to smile and patiently explaining some foreign dessert dish to try. Kudos for Linda's customer service. All, my experience stay at Sutasoma would be a 5 stars one if it would not bumped down a little by the disrespectful guests next door. Will I stay again in the future? Yes I will. AJ"

It was nice experience. + Nice interior from lobby to the room + Very hygiene + Great pool and gym (if not crowded) + Great services from the staffs + Great flavor for breakfast + Near to MRT, Korean supermarket, and great choices for ordering online delivery for food - Noises heard from other rooms (i stayed at deluxe room) - Not have a great view in the room - No extra covid protocol - High price for 4 stars hotels"
Sutasoma Hotel,indah Chosar,5.0,"One of the inspiring hotels that I have ever visited. The staff were friendly and ready to help, the food was delicious, the rooms were clean and comfortable with nuances like on the island of Bali, and an excellent internet connection. thank you sutasoma🙏"
Sutasoma Hotel,Sofi Reksoyudo,4.0,"nice comfy strategic hotel next to The Tribrata as one of the famous ballroom for wedding parties. the hotel itself is new and very clean and neat. Breakfast and dinner were delicious, very fond of the pastries here! one of the best I think! so yummy! staf, security and waitress were all very friendly. Very near the Blok A MRT, The hotel is also near Blok M and Blok A so there are going to be plenty things you can do around the area"

Sutasoma Hotel,Riska Nur Putri,2.0,"The hotel ambience was perfect, the room was also amazing, but the receptionist’ service is REALLY BAD. I call them today to extend my stay in Sutasoma for 1 day and they said it’s okay and giving me rate for 700+ per night. I am okay with it and said I’ll complete the payment by 12.30 pm. 15 minutes later, they called me again to confirm if I want to extend again, and I said yes why they ask again? And they give me DIFFERENT RATES at 900+ per night because they said the demand is high and since I am not confirmed yet I have to follow the higher rates because THEIR DEMAND IS HIGH. It’s not making any sense and they are also not giving any solution why they’re saying A in 10 minutes later saying B."

The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,The Reviewer,5.0,Lovely Hotel! Staff were attentive and the places was clean. All the facilities were up to date except for the bathroom which smelled like old rusty pipes. The hallways had a lovely smell of jasmine and lemongrass. The room was well planned and the balcony was a nice addition.

The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Sani Ario,5.0,"One of my personal favorite lux botique hotel in Jakarta. Why go to yet another boring American 5 star chain when you can go and support a local entity, with a rich nuance of Javanese interior? The place smells amazing. The outdoor and indoor pool are well kept. The gym is complete and well equipped. Service was professional and warm, they all remembered me by name and no request was too difficult. Yes this place may be a bit dear for pricing, but it's worth every rupiah. Location is also amazing, in the midst of the leafy suburb of Dharmawangsa giving a cool respite to Jakarta's hot weather. An oasis and haven for tired souls."
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Michael Gielink,4.0,Very luxurious and spacious and colonial. Fantastic out door pool area and indoor gym with infinity pool. Service is excellent - however expensive for Indonesia.
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Paolo Josef Garcia,5.0,"I love everything about The Dharmawangsa Jakarta. The hotel is truly a showcase of Indonesian art and heritage while the staff epitomize the very best of Indonesian hospitality and culture. The hotel is located in an upscale residential area of South Jakarta with lots of green spaces and about a 15-minute leisurely walk to the Blok A MRT station. In contrast to the ultra-modern hotels in the bustling Jakarta CBD, The Dharmawangsa is at once homey and intimate with its classic architectural style and beautiful furnishings. Their Executive Rooms are spacious and larger than most similarly priced hotel rooms in the city. The equally spacious marble bathroom had double vanity basins which was a nice touch. What also sets the hotel apart is their absolutely exceptional food. The Beef Rendang at the Jakarta Restaurant was sublime and the best rendang I have ever had so far. Thoroughly enjoyed their take on nasi goreng kambing as well. Special mention to Sevira who was so helpful with menu recommendations and her cheerful attitude and personalized service made my dining experience great both times. The breakfast and ambience at The Courtyard was a delight too! Needless to say, I'll definitely be back!"

The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,VC SOEGIJANTO,5.0,EXCELLENT... what a nice hotel to stay in.. with a wide balcony facing the pool and the garden that face east..so its very cooling in the morning. First class amenities all in perfect condition. And the food is simply excellent. Service that is very warm and personalised. Definitely new favourite hotel in Jakarta
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Globetrotter Monk,2.0,"I stayed in Dharmawangsa for my 5 days mandatory quarantine. I picked this Hotel was mainly due to a room with balcony where you can enjoy fresh air looking at lush gardens during quarantine. When entering the room, you felt travelling back in time capsule with classic 90s. The room was extremely outdated and tired. The bed mattress was sinking and not supporting body posture when lying down. The bed light and standing light were dimmed, and the electrical plugs were loose. Another major issue was the room cleanliness. I found a piece of french fries on the floor from the previous guest. The sofa fabric and carpet had a few dirty spots, and the worst was stained on toilet bowl. I wonder with the cleaning procedure was being done properly in this Hotel which I believe the assigned quarantine rooms thoroughly cleaning should be done after the guest checking out. The food quality especially on international menu also needs to be improved, its taste was far below the 5 stars Hotel standard. For my next mandatory quarantine, a room with balcony will not be on my list."
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,pa Kafid,5.0,"Lovely dining hall, nice jasmine smell around the building… nice view to the pool"
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Antero Almeida,4.0,"I quarantined at The Dharmawangsa when I entered Indonesia... I did not get the opportunity to check all the hotel but the service was friendly and very attentive, the bed and room was very comfortable, the food was very good, both the international and Asian. I would like to give them a five star but first I need to check the rest of the hotel. I would highly recommend it"
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,cipta khairina,3.0,"Thos hotel is not like Dharmasangsa we've known 5 or 10 years ago. The service was poor and interior is outdated. Bed was small and sinking far from a 5 star hotel standard. The coffee table in the balcony was outdated and damaged. The receptionist omg, i came around 13.50, and they dont give us approximate time to wait for the room is ready. I dont understand why it takes so long to make the room ready. I repeatedly ask how long and the receptionist said it will take another 40 mnts, gosh that was unacceptable for a 5 star hotel that was not fully occupied. And some other disappointment service. Fortunately i get the pool view room and it's refreshing."
The Dharmawangsa Jakarta,Edbert Tjoniko,2.0,"Definitely not as how the pictures on the website depicted. Not all rooms are facing the inside of the hotel to give the resort vibe. The one I got is stuck with views of building ledge. The room is pretty old. One outlet was almost coming out of the wall. I sat on the sofa in my shorts and had rashes in minutes. Doors are hard to open. The room furnishing do need some serious refurbishment. Unfortunately staff are not trained well before put on the job. Their heart is in right place but falls short in execution due to lack of experience and training On check-in, they charged our card wrongly. Key card was not configured correctly so we were left waiting at the doorstep for quite awhile. Phone was faulty in the room. Restaurant food is mediocre, highly overpriced and worse of all, waiters are overwhelmed. The entire area is filled with mosquitoes. Please wear long sleeve clothing to avoid tons of bites. It feels a lot more like a 3 and 4 star experience. For the price, go to other hotels in Jakarta for a much more relaxed and pleasant stay. Only good thing is the courtyard style swimming pool fhat gives you a resort vibe. Pretty hard to find, but would recommend Four Seasons one over this. No reason to come back here again until they update their service, room and amenities."

Very much recommended. Good hospitality."

The FO was so helpful too, they also informed us at the check in desk about the gigs and DJ stuffs, thanks. Also i love the hot latte, ordered it 2 days straight along with the breakfast. Pleasant stay in here. P.S If you’re a light sleeper, it might not be a great hotel for you."

Hotel Monopoli,Viktor Iwan,3.0,"Smells cigarette all over the room for this non smoking hotel. Not really understand the concept of having shower room with a glass-through view.. unless its useful for ""adult"" purpose. Clearly the hotel is not build as family hotel to enjoy kemang. It's 3 star for my Family Trip to enjoy long weekend BUT if its for a business trip OR adult trips.. the hotel is nice! Strategic location and walking distance to interesting places like mall, coffee shop and other f&b. The wifi is also okay for working remote or staycation."
Hotel Monopoli,Ideli R,2.0,"The only good thing is the design and concept. The walls are very thin, we can hear voices from other rooms. The room can definitely be redone, there were dirty spots on the seating. The worst part was the shower; the water did not fall rightly. Air conditioner was directly beside the bed, and they turned the AC off in the middle of the night. Parking lot was limited, it’s difficult to find a spot, and it seemed unsafe as well to park on the street."

Reception not customer oriented, no service excellent even no smiling voice when you call a reveption especially staff namely NADIA. Never ever comeback to this hotel. Room small and just so so. Parking area view. No town or anything just park area. Request high floor but given second floor. Want to upgrade my room to higher room cuase after we check in we think its to small, first one they said it cost IDR100.000,- and when I called again they said it will be IDR200.000,- cause we already enter the room? Like what? The price increase after 1 hour. Your customer willing to pay but this is not how you doing bussiness. NEVER EVER COMEBACK!"
Hotel Monopoli,Hanna Manurung,3.0,"Room interior is attractive, bathroom is thoughtfully designed to separate showering area and toilet seat, Air Conditioner is functioning very very well, cleanliness is handled properly as room is neatly tidied and cleaned, location is very strategic and close to daily go-to necessities like coffee shop, resto, book store, grocery store. However, Monopoli Hotel needs to take serious action for improvement on: 1) Hotel Policy, rooftop has karaoke facility which is extremely LOUD and DISTURBING customer who is resting at night, owner should not merge karaoke area altogether with hotel in one building, please consider to have separate building for karaoke, and this has been the most common complaint for months from customer yet still going on. Owner does not take this into consideration maybe? 2) Poor Signal, for price IDR 640,000 per night, wifi signal is very very poor, please provide wifi signal properly, 3) No Motorbike Parking Lot, i had to park my bike at Tanamera’s since Monopoli Hotel does not provide basement or back area for parking, this also has been second most commom complaint from customer, yet again owner does not take this into consideration? 4) Employee’s friendliness. Security at the front door was WAY MUCH NICER and friendlier than staff at the front desk/receptionist. No automatic greeting from afar from staff, talks casually to me while i’m asking, seemed to be kinda impatient when explaining payment for 50% charge early checking and IDR 300,000 for down payment fee. As i believe owner will read and reply this, i am so looking forward for Monopoli Hotel fully commit to take action on improvement seriously and very soon."
Hotel Monopoli,Andra Maulana,4.0,"Great experience staying there for the weekend. Surprisingly got the Grand Deluxe with the mezzanine. Plus is you got a separate area for sleeping, minus is when you're in bed and need to go for number 1 in the middle of the night, you have to navigate up and down the stairs since the bathroom is in the 1st floor. The location is also prime for ordering food from some of the nicest South Jakarta places. Skip the bfast, and just cross the road for some Starbucks or order something online from GoFood/Grabfood."

Hotel Monopoli,Sekar Karindra,1.0,"This used to be one of my fav hotel in Jakarta. But recently, I’m quite disappointed with their service. I had a booking for 2 nights and when I was about to check in, there was flood (yeah, you know Kemang area), I asked for a refund / reschedule directly to the hotel, the staff seemed okay with my request but asked me to call traveloka to make the change. After calling traveloka, they confirmed that the hotel didn’t grant my request with no particular reason. So if it’s rainy season, better stay somewhere else. Or if you already booked it and some out-of-your-control situation happen (e.g. flood, unless you’re God then obv you can control flood) better pray they’re willing to compensate."
Hotel Monopoli,Jummi Ishijima,3.0,"One of the best designed rooms but unfortunately I had to check out after one night because the music and noise from the rooftop bar was unbearable. Initially had a mezzanine room on the top floor but the sound and vibrations could be felt right through so I moved to a room on the 3rd floor but still could hear everything and couldn't sleep until 4 am. If I was in Jakarta to enjoy the nightlife, will definitely stay here but not when I actually need to sleep at night. They have regular shows several nights a week so nice place to have fun. Love love love the rooms!!"
Hotel Monopoli,Tari Danawidjaja,2.0,"This hotel is beautifully designed, it really represents the New York style- very chic and stylish. Staff are very friendly and warm, check-in was also very smooth. However, we didn’t check review about the hotel, so we were really surprised when the front desk informed us about the noise. We decided to take the twin bed on 2nd floor, and when the night came- it was so noisy both from the rooftop and ground floor. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who needs good sleep, unless you wanna party till late and don’t need to sleep. Even if you sleep w plugs- u can still hear the noise. I ended up slept at 4am. Breakfast was mediocre, there were small plates of fruits left, they only refill the pineapple, got scramble eggs and the rest mostly consist of breads. A hot porridge would be really nice actually, or just walk down the street and you will find traditional Indo porridge for a very good price!"
Hotel Monopoli,Randy,4.0,"a good place to stay. in the heart of central kemang, so its easy to go to entertainment area. quite fair price, you got breakfast, because corona, so they deliver the breakfast to your room. the car park is not much, sometimes you have to park in side road which is hold by some unknown people, and you have to pay 35K IDR first if you stay. the pool is small, cant swim. they got bar in rooftop"
Hotel Monopoli,Melvin rodgers,1.0,"stayed near to top floor and there an event on..as usual so the staff said we went up to the rooftop bar there was no event and it was empty alomost, just the staff liked to play loud music. very unlpeasant experience. if you want a good nights sleep do not stay at this hotel.Rooms: 2/5 | Service: 1/5 | Location: 3/5 …More"
Hotel Monopoli,Indri Yunita,4.0,"Get transported back in time with the sweet vintage decor like nowhere else in Jakarta. Loved the ambience. But please be warned that this is a party hotel as they seem to make major cash from hosting events on weekends at the 2 clubs on the rooftop and in the basement. I stayed on 3rd level and the music from the rooftop was loud. I was aware of this prior to booking but booked it anyway. They also warned me during check in. It was not a big problem for me but I can see why people give 1 stars. I guess they came unprepared. So in conclusion, best way to enjoy your stay here is 1. Check the party on their IG 2. Check in and get prepared for the party 3. Party til drop. 4. Collapse on your bed. Definitely not for business travelers and family."
Hotel Monopoli,Ferdy Pratama,5.0,"such a good experience to stay in here with a unique interior and a clean environment, if you need some entertainment there are 2 bars in roof top and in underground with weekly frequent music events. their breakfast actually pretty tasty with moderate choices menus. and plus, the soap and shampoos are from the good vibes organic (one of indonesia’s local brand) it makes the bathing experiences so greatttt!"
Hotel Monopoli,Tom Srn,3.0,"Good hipsterish hotel with cool rooftop and friendly staff. The rooms were very clean, well designed and generally very nice.The somewhat elitist crowd makes it almost feel awkward to be here though. The club and bar seem to be a meeting place for the local Jakarta elite and go on playing loud music until 2am. The breakfast was good, but very very little. Regarding that it was the most expensive hotel breakfast during our trip in Indonesia, that was quite disappointing."
Hotel Monopoli,Gunadi Kr,5.0,"Great dinner buffet at Bloom. Their buffet price exclude beverages, you need to buy your own drink. Not only many main course dishes available, many choice of cake is available too. Reservation before arrival is strongly recommended"

Hotel Monopoli,Fahry Pradipta,4.0,"Went there to dine for the buffet the food was alright for its price, didn't expect anything too fancy but was treated with its own take of fancy.

Hotel Monopoli,Kevin N.,5.0,"Great all-in-one solution for a whole evening. Start with nice dinner at the Ground Floor, then go upstairs to the rooftop for some pre-drinks and when you're in the mood, go to the basement and dance off! Never spent a night in one of their rooms, but i can imagine it's very loud. So, better sleep somewhere else."
grandkemang Jakarta,william sandler,2.0,"Very loud band plays til 2AM so loud guest room windows shake, door knobs vibrate, image in mirror distorts “with the beat” making sleep or concentration, impossible. Rooms are large. No balconies. Windows don’t open. Controls for lights AC etc on 20 year old bedside consule antique but still work. Smell of room musty. Toilet requires multiple handle jiggles to turn off. Location excellent. Everything close-by. Hotel needs a renovation modernization until that’s done don’t overpay here! Our room around 400.000 (about USD$30) which is about right for the condition/quality of this older property. WiFi strength mixed depending on where in this large property."
grandkemang Jakarta,Dody Barus,3.0,"Located on the heart of kemang, south jakarta, with many places to go around in walking distance.. It is a nice place when you've already there.. But the effort to be there is another different story.. You will face a common high traffic congestion.. Now about the property. Usually it was a nice place to spend my weekend. Spacious and clean room, well decorated.. I only have one complaint about watter supply in bath room.. The shower was too weak in room 346. Other than that, I have nothing to complaint. But.. It was last month. This month, they ask a deposit @Rp. 300.000 per stay, which is not really convenient for me. Im looking forward to find alternatives cos this ""new policy""."

My voucher (via traveloka) stated start 11-16 august 2022 instead of 4-9 august 2022. I tried to explained to the receptionist that i've made wrong order and ask their help to contact traveloka to changed the date. I inform to him previously i had same case and could clear with hotel staff help (i show him evidence as well). But the receptionist just said he can not do that without any effort/willingness to help. He only gave a reason because my voucher is non refundable so i can make any change and i should keep on my schedule or should let my money gone ! It's very DISSAPPOINTED ! I stay this hotel in many times i visit jakarta but they treat their customer like this ?? I asked further do they have available room ? They said have, but just can not help as my proposal. Sorry to say, this last time i made booking with this hotel because many other hotel will treat their customer better for sure !!"

grandkemang Jakarta,Peter Stolk,5.0,The Grandkemang is the Grand Old Lady of hotels where to stay when you travels brings you to Kemang or South Jakarta in general. Over the many years of operating the property has seen several renovation to keep up with time. Like all hotels during the covid period business was a challenge however during my recent visit I noted the property was clean and well maintained. Keep up the good work and look forward to my next visit at Grandkemang.

grandkemang Jakarta,Sean Muniandy,1.0,"Good location within kemang area.. the rest about this hotel is just questionable! I lived in Kemang for years and have been to this hotel many times but with current stay it’s just awful.. the room is dirty, towels were run down and disgusting and on the first day there was not even one, bed covers were old even wet yesterday, the room carpet dirty and I would never walk barefoot, ac didn’t even worked on the first day, I booked for the grand deluxe room and they arranged for deluxe upon arrival and then pretended they didn’t know on my booking..today at 10pm In bed I discover small miniature flights. Everything about this hotel is just shameful and dirty. I have read so many negative comments about this hotel since checked in and this will be last time I will stay here.. shame on you grand kemang management"
grandkemang Jakarta,J T,3.0,"Quarantined here for a week after travel. It wasnt perfect. I think my two biggest complaints were a bar that plays loud music at nights nextdoor until ~12am (most rooms are not near it, i got unlucky) and that a couple of the meals were pretty bad, like gross, like it had been in the fridge for too long and then microwaved like crazy. Overall my stay was pretty good though, especially for the price. The food was decent excluding the couple times it was old, and the one time i ordered in an a la carte burger it was big, cooked fresh, and very delicious - higher quality than the general quarantine food. The staff were very friendly, although most didnt speak that good of english. Everything in the room was generally clean and functional. All considered... well, I probably would not book this place again. The couple times of bad food and the music was too much. It was alright though. For non-quarantine stay the place seemed very nice."
grandkemang Jakarta,Wildan Baraba,4.0,"Cool place! They have some kind of art gallery in the lobby. Check-in was fast and accomodate my needs. Strategically located in the bustling Kemang area. Parking area rather large, but because many guests, we ended up parked in basement. No big deal. The room was spacious, but quite old. And they give me view to other building wall. Not comfortable to open my room curtain. For breakfast, i didn't taste i, because they can't deliver our breakfast to room. Well, i guess because they're so busy that morning, since there was lot of government event there."
grandkemang Jakarta,Febby Sabatira,1.0,"This is probably the WORST 4 stars hotel ive ever been to. 1. I stayed for 2 nights and those 2 nights this hotel blacked out for 2-5 minutes at 1 AM at night 2. The staffs STOP RECEIVING CALL after 11 PM 3. I had to change rooms 3 times because something always broken, the AC and the toilet😂 4. I went downstairs to front desk to request something for my room. THEY NEVER DELIVERS IT. I Called and NO ONE IS NEVER THERE. All of them. The front desk, room service, concierge, operator. ALL OF THEM. 5. They dont refill the soap and shampoo, also change toilet paper from previous guest. 6. The room is very dusty. I would NEVER comeback here again."
grandkemang Jakarta,또또니,3.0,"They are trying to provide kind and good service.But the rooms, air conditioners, beds, and towels were all old and smelly. There are many foods in the morning, but it doesn't taste good. Even the nasi goreang was not delicious in room service food. I won't recommend it.It has the advantage of being close to KemangMall."
grandkemang Jakarta,Bhita Hervita,3.0,"Stayed for couple of nights, upon room cleaning they don’t even put out the trash?? Also wifi is so bad. Not even once did they refill the toilet tissue. TV was old and the remote was lost so had to push the button They don’t check on how many nights people are gonna stay and only give the card key that can be used 1 nights. Have to GO BACK to receptionist TWICE (and my room is so far and high) to redo the card key. So annoying. Lift was old and so slow. Plus size: room was spacious."
grandkemang Jakarta,Penjelajah BUMI,1.0,"Don't leave security/bellboy behind to transport belongings on checkout. They'll treat as if you left your belongings behind and a potential criminal. They tried to photo my ID without consent during pick up. One receptionist told the other to swiftly take a photo with their smartphone, without explaining why they need it. I understand they're just following SOP as told by management, but forcefully recording personal data invades customer privacy. I was showing my passport and let them note down the data, however they're not satisfied, inconsiderate to potential identity theft of customers. Edit: not recommended for quarantine stay, they are often late and underserve in delivering food. They distribute your passport image via Whatsapp at the airport."
grandkemang Jakarta,arka nanta,1.0,"i’ve been here for 2 days for NYE. I called the house keeping few times to clean room, but there’s no response. i’ve pressed the “make up” button before i leave for hours. and the night i came back, my room’s not cleaned up yet. i think this is the most terrible 4-stars hotel i’ve ever seen so far. and remember, this hotel is located at South Jakarta but doesn’t feels like it"
grandkemang Jakarta,Harry Ferdiansyah,5.0,"Five stars for the location and Prayer Room. Somehow I was lost on my way to the meeting room (from the basement). Oh.. They need to provide lifts for some meeting rooms, not all have the ability to use the stairs"
grandkemang Jakarta,Leon Leon,1.0,"On 27th Dec 2021, I reserved one room in GrandKemang on New Year’s Eve, using Agoda. On 31st Dec, My daughter (2 y.o) and I arrived at 5. p.m at the hotel. We came from town, outside Jakarta. We then went to the reception to do the check-in. But I was so frustrated to learn from the receptionist (William) that he could not find my reservation. This problem was so unbelievable! I had received the confirmation from Agoda, and it HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL. Then I asked him to check again with Agoda. He said the fault is in Agoda, that Agoda has not confirmed the room to them or paid them. I don’t know if this was the real problem since it was in their reservation system. However, as the customer, I never expected this kind of thing to happen. Particularly since I already paid in full, and it was new year’s eve, it would be hard to find another hotel. Not to mention, traffic in Jakarta would be so crowded on that night for my daughter and me to wander around and find an available hotel. My daughter and I stood in front of the receptions for about 1 hour! Nobody offered us to sit and find the solution. They also let 4 – 5 other persons queued behind us. Unbelieve! They could add another check-in counter or at least ask them to sit while they resolve my issue. I still can’t believe how they treat the customer. Since I didn’t find any solutions offered by the receptions, I asked to talk to the manager. Then the manager finally offered my daughter and me to sit. He again emphasized that this was Agoda’s fault and had nothing to do with them. I asked him if he could help me find another hotel, and he said I needed to wait for the Agoda’s PIC to contact me. Is it that difficult, Grand Kemang? Could you just help a mom and a daughter to find a place to stay? If you help me do so, I will consider paying on my account for the new hotel! But you did not. The manager also said that the only help he could offer was to contact Agoda related to this issue. Then the Agoda team would contact me. However, I did not receive any phone or email until around 7.15 p.m. It was also when I finally decided to leave the hotel, as my daughter was already tired of waiting for something uncertain. Then finally, Agoda emails came at 7.30 p.m., offering the refund and finding another accommodation. But I think it was too late. I was already tired of the lousy service from both of them. I will never reserve any room from Agoda and Grand Kemang. And for Grand Kemang, if you think Agoda is a bad travel agent (as per your suggestion in our discussion), why would you still collaborate with them? You would disappoint your next customer. Or maybe the customer is in that priority for you? In the end, I just want to say thank you to Agoda and GrandKemang for making the worst new year’s eve for my daughter and me!"
grandkemang Jakarta,iim hs,2.0,"Dear grandkemang, please consider this as an input. For 4stars hotel I expect more especially from your staffs. First. On my second day staying there, i have to upgrade my keycard. When I asked the receptionist whether i have to upgrading it again tomorrow she asked how long i stay. How could they didnt know the length of the stay of their guest? and if i am not asking then i have to upgrade my key card every day??? Second. I am asking about the laundry service, all they (people in recepsionist) talk about is they dont know. Third. I am asking about if i could use the welcome drink. Again, they said i dont know. What exactly they know. Other than that, you need to put attention in to your room carpet, its full of dust and the cutlery, left for more than two days in the alley, its disturbing. Its not the pleasant experience, but hopefully you guys could improve your service to your customer, remembering that this is the 4 stars hotel in the golden area of Jakarta."

Park Regis Arion,Yosep JNK,2.0,"I stayed there for two days in a so-called the ""Deluxe Room"" and I had a really bad onboarding experience with this hotel. The first room assigned to me was a disaster. The room telephone was not working, neither was the temperature controller. The toilet bowl had some yellow stains on it. The shower head was rusty, even the closet doors were also stuck. I asked the receptionist for another room, but they told me to stay there. After some discussion with the room technician, they agreed to move me to another room. The only thing that was great about this hotel, was the location."

Park Regis Arion,Tony Willoughby,2.0,"Perhaps my experience was due to COVID restrictions, but it was a horrid stay. The general ambiance of the hotel is average but the rooms are aging and service is non-existent. -toilet did not flush properly and was very noisy during refill -no hot water -no electric kettle for the coffee/tea service -no shower or hand soap -WIFI very slow and with frequent disconnects I paid extra for breakfast service and was informed it would be delivered to my room due to lockdown and that someone would call each evening to take my order. The first evening nobody called so I missed breakfast before my early meeting. The next evening someone did call and took my order for 7:00AM delivery but by 8:00 AM still no breakfast and I had to depart for the train station. There are better options within walking distance of this hotel, so look elsewhere."

Great location despite the traffic, strategic location in kemang, it’s always traffic on weekend to commute, you can walk nearby cafe and restaurant. Clean small rooftop pool is one of the perks (however they don’t provide towel so bring your own towel) The gym equipment needs updating. Superior room was decent size and had everything required for a comfortable stay."

Park Regis Arion,atik ambarwati,5.0,"I have visited and stayed in this hotel since its name was still Grand Flora. I love the design of the building, which always gives me feeling of calm. I like the ambience in its lobby when it is not too crowded, as many weddings are usually held in this hotel. The building looks elegant without looking too massive and large. Although the building has been old, but the hotel management seems to have worked hard in maintaining its fresh and charming ambience of the building like what I remember in the past."
Park Regis Arion,Peter,5.0,"One of the best hotels we ever stayed in Kemang area, South Jakarta. We stayed in the executive the luxe suite with view over Kemang and a nice living room. The rooms are recently renovated, clean and have a very nice bed to sleep at. The breakfast is everyday different and tasty. The staff are awesome and will help you with everything you needed. The General Manager, Mr Deva is a nice person and really willing to help with everything you asked. We recommend to everyone to stay here."
Park Regis Arion,Isa Adi S,5.0,Good service and nice room (superior) in a good location (kemang). I stayed here for a quarantine periode after working offshore during covid pandemic. They work with a tight protocol and make sure I dont need to leave the room. After PCR test (negative) I checked out. Recommended for quarantine yourself during the covid outbreak and protect your loved ones
Park Regis Arion,Camille Secioria,5.0,"A very nice place to stay in the busy area, great services, and the price is so affordable. Definitely we'll be back for more"
Park Regis Arion,Krish,4.0,"The place is good for the price. The only thing that is a disappointment is the shower. And you need to wait for almost 5 mins for hot water to come. (Not giving a 5 start because of that) Room is really big, clean. Room service is good. Certainly worth more than what you pay. The only thing that you need to remember is that these guys will say a yes to everything. So don't assume that they understood you. (I just enquired about a dish and ordered another dish. I ended up getting both)"

Park Regis Arion,Menik Bud,4.0,"Before i went here, i read some reviews, a bit worried that this hotel would be that 'not good'. Then, when i arrived here, it's actually not bad at all. Enough room size, spacious bathroom, hot shower, clean, no weird smell. It's just old interior design, that's it, and really nothing matter with that. It even looks classic. The internet connection is sufficient. I tried the dinner buffet, it was fine, tasty food - eventhough the dessert was just ok. Overall it's worth staying, especially when you really want to stay around Kemang area. Spacious parking lot for medium size hotel."
Park Regis Arion,Pius Wisnugraha Trias,2.0,"There's even no health check entry, no hand sanitizer at public areas except on front desk resto, hot water don't work good, towel's smell bad, resto menu not taste good. But the hotel staff was polite and helpful"

Park Regis Arion,Mark Kilner,3.0,"A recently refurbished 3 star, 85 room hotel in Kemang's main street at 4 star prices. Rooms are tiled, not carpeted with refurbishment not extending to the bathrooms. Some rooms were being sprayed for bed bug infestation at the time (Dec. 2018). Water in the shower was warm at best throughout the hotel. Room safes could not be opened. No mini bar stocking. Service was friendly. Housekeeping lacked vacuum cleaners to clean the thin room rug under the coffee table."
Park Regis Arion,zul khaidir,3.0,"I have some features that I dont like, maybe not that important, but quite sensitive for me. The food was not delicious, LCD is not fixed LCD but still the portable one, but sometimes with low contrast. A lift button for down sing is not lighting (although still functioning). Plus points are the officers are kind (although some are not), and have quite strategic location. Mini mart is just 10 minutes walk. Also, In my room, iron and hair dryer are available. Swimming and gym located at seventh floor."
Park Regis Arion,Naftali Halberstadt,3.0,"It's okay, no more than that. Service is proper without anyone taking any initiative. Rooms should have been redone a decade ago.

Park Regis Arion,Dela,3.0,"The hotel is noticable from the street. It is located in Kemang and have cool place surrounding the hotel. Its' interior look sophisticated, but old. The service is awesome, the room just so comfy and the price is so-so. However....the food served there just not so good for the 4 star hotel like Park Regis. It is so sad to know this. I think they should improve how they cook and serve any kind of food there. On the otherside, they have many promotions which guests can enjoy. My fav is the 50% promo for the cake after 4PM hours. The cake is delicious, and you can order it from your room. If you would like to know more, just ask the receptionist when you check in. For thw meeting room, for me it was well-equipped. However the room is so small. 😥😥😥😥 Another thing should be improved is the cleanliness around. But overal.....I think all is well here."
Park Regis Arion,Ivan Yudhi,3.0,"I must say I'm a bit disappointed about this hotel. I stayed here for almost two weeks for a job. It's actually the first time ever I'm staying at a hotel in Jakarta (my family lives in this city). The breakfast is subpar, and they serve pretty much the same thing every day. I cancelled my breakfast package for the second week. I'd rather just walk a bit to Indomaret and Starbucks to get some snacks and coffee for breakfast. The room is quite old and doesn't look very nice. I stayed in the executive room for a few days and the sliding door broke. The phone also broke after a few days. Overall I don't think I'll stay here again if I'm about to stay in Kemang area again. I'd rather try Grand Kemang which is not much further than this hotel."
Park Regis Arion,adi purnomo,4.0,A good 3 stars hotel. The food is ok. Eventhough the desserts is below expectation. The meeting room quite descent. Overall clean and well maintenance hotel. The staffs are quite friendly. A good option for budget hotel around kemang.
Park Regis Arion,Audi Kasbara,4.0,"It's an upscale medium-sized hotel at the heart of Kemang that offers cozy ambient and casual atmosphere. It has all amenities required as 4 - star hotel. Dining lounges, cafe, club, meeting rooms, fitness area, swimming pool etc."
Park Regis Arion,Adhit Adhityawarman,2.0,"Attended a training here. Room was old, but just OK. Food, however, poor. Selection of menus was terrible, taste of most menus were horrible.Service was even worse. During a break time no cutleries provided, no sugar provided for the tea and coffee, and no one attended our room."
